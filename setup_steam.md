# Setup Steam Game Server

:::tip
If you are using Linux, we recommend that you deploy the steam server using a Docker image. [More information](/setup_docker_image.md)
:::

## Install SteamCMD

No matter which Steam game server you want to run, `PalWorld`, `CS2`, `ARK`, or others, `SteamCMD` is required to download and update the server.

- [For Windows SteamCMD](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/SteamCMD#Windows)

- [For Linux SteamCMD](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/SteamCMD#Linux)

## Create an Instance

1. Go to the `Instances` page and click the `Create` button.
2. Select `Steam Game Server`.
3. Select the machine (node) where you would like to deploy the server.
4. Select `No Additional File Required`.
5. Configure the startup command following the official documentation (if any).

## Obtain the Installation Command

***Note: This is NOT the startup command***\
The same command is used to install and update the server. Each Steam game server has a unique `APP ID`, you will need this ID before running the following command:
:::tip
The `APP ID` for the game itself and it's dedicated server is usually different. In most cases, we want to use the one for the dedicated server. [Find the APP ID](https://steamdb.info/)
:::

```bash
"<SteamCMD Location>" +force_install_dir "{mcsm_workspace}" +login anonymous "+app_update <APP ID> validate" +quit
```

`Project Zomboid Dedicated Server` as an exampleï¼š

```bash
"C:/SteamCMD/steamcmd.exe" +force_install_dir "/dir/to/your/game/" +login anonymous "+app_update 380870 validate" +quit
```

## Configure the MCSManager

Add the `steamcmd ....` command obtained in the previous step to the `Update Command` in the `Instance Settings`. Click the `Update` button to install/Update the Steam server.

Once installed/updated, click the 'Start' button to start your server.
:::tip
In some cases, adding `validate` to the update command will result in damaged savings, especially when it's in the same directory as the server. If you are unsure about this, create a backup before each update and/or remove the `validate` portion from the update command.)
